Use this to collect scrap notes without any organisation.

## Homework

The homework is available in the [GitHub Repo.](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-homework)

Doing the code after every chapter is important to consolidate the idea for
each chapter.

The homework README contains how to use the file for the homework.
It is a self-contained environment. Read the instructions present
therein to make the best of it.

## Working through the homework, and more

Working through the homework: copy the respective folder, and
complete the homework. Make modifications as needed.

### C and H Files

The header files must have a corresponding `.c` files if they define any custom
C-code in it. In this specific case, the C-file must also be part of the
compilation step.

### Testing in C

Since C does not have default testing suite, it will be fun to write up a basic
test framework for C, to be specifically used here in the ostep project.

#### TODO

- go through some examples of how tests are structured, and/or written
- create an arch diagram for the test suite
- write MVP
- write tests
- refactor and improve
